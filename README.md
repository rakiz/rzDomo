This project started as a simple pool temperature monitoring, providing only an Access Point to see latest value.
Then it started to evolved to include other sensors such as air temperature, PH, turbidity, UV index... Each one needing to be calibrated.
On the display side, it was no longer just a value, but curves, with automatic update.

And then another sensor was needed to monitor a greenhouse; then another sensor was needed to monitor a bee hive.

As the calibration of each sensor was being compiled, we wanted to add configuration screens that would automatically generate a configuration based on the available sensors.

The project is just starting over, trying to put together pieces that will help me (maybe not only) doing new IoT projects without fighting again and again with the same issues.
